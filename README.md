Introduction
------------

This logging component provides a C++ abstract API, which enables your application to send logs either to the console, to 
a file, or to the DLT, in a transparent way, without having to explicitly rely on the DLT API.
For more documentation about that software component, please refer to the doxygen documentation, which gets generated when
building the package (see the file "INSTALL.md"). Open the file "doc/doxygen/html/index.html" from the build folder.
