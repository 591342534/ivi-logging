Introduction
------------

IVI Logging is a tool to facilitate the use of Diagnostic Log and Trace (DLT) software, like that found in GENIVI. The logging 
component provides a C++ API enabling you to send log data either to the console, to a file, or even to DLT transparently and 
without having to rely on DLT.
For more documentation about that software component, please refer to the doxygen documentation, which gets generated when
building the package (see the file "INSTALL.md"). Open the file "doc/doxygen/html/index.html" from the build folder.
